# AceBook

The card wall for this project showing how we estimated the lenght of tasks, division of work and iterative deployment as per Agile principles, is here: https://trello.com/b/eSDBp5iu/ajax-acebook.

We have also recorded our standups and retros and also learning points here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ohjv9JBgKYqyUJgje8z_QG9PYIkzNuMksxugn8j5Awo/edit

In order to test the application you will have to sign up via https://github.com/AlinaGoaga/AJAX-AceBook. 
In future releases we are planning to introduce the functionality on this version which will remove the need to sign up via the old repo.

## Quickstart

First, clone this repository. Then:

```bash
> bundle install
> bin/rails db:create
> bin/rails db:migrate
> bin/rails server # Start the server at localhost:3000
```
